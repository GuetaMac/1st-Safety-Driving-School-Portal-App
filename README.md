# 1st Safety Driving School Portal

A Mobile App System for Streamlined Student Management and Data-Driven Analytics

## Project Description

Driving schools play a critical role in developing skilled and responsible drivers. However, many institutions, including 1st Safety Driving School (FSDS), still depend on manual methods like Google Sheets for managing student records, schedules, and enrollments. These traditional practices can lead to inefficiencies, inaccuracies, system delays, overbooking, and scheduling errors.

To solve these challenges, we developed the 1st Safety Driving School Portal â€“ a mobile application designed to automate student enrollment, schedule management, and progress tracking. This system aims to streamline operations, reduce manual workload, and minimize human error. The portal provides an improved experience for managers, administrative staff, instructors, and students by centralizing all processes.
